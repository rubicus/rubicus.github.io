# Jekyll docs site

This directory contains the code for my blog!

## Code

Most of the code for this website comes from the [Jekyll documentation webpage](http://jekyllrb.com/),
but has been modded a lot by me to suite my needs for a blogging platsform. Among other things, there
is support for tags for example, and a lot of unneeded functionality has been removed from the original 
site.

## TODO

* Write more blog posts
* Fix the not working icon
* Write number of posts of each category
* Fix so that tags of a post look better and link to correct tag page!
* Remove a bunch of old unused tag folders
* double check that the template for tags is up to date with the blog tag
* Make the author link write my name instead of nick (use config with variables)
* Add github icon to github link
* Add more links and stuff on about page (linkedin etc)
* Get a better github profile picture
* Add comment functionality (disquss?)
* Add fucntionlity for pictures with posts
* Make only parts of the posts (tohether with picture) show on the front page
* Add "next"/"prev" buttons to new posts from old posts (look at other blogs)
* Limit number of posts shown per page
* Make an archive for old blog posts
