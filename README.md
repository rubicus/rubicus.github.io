# My blog

This repository contains the code for my blog!

## Code

Most of the code for this website comes from the [Jekyll documentation webpage](http://jekyllrb.com/),
but has been modded a lot by me to suite my needs for a blogging platform. Among other things, there
is support for tags for example, and a lot of unneeded functionality has been removed from the original
site. Also lots of cosmetic changes I find nice.

## TODO (maybe, at some point)

* make more interesting background with picture or similar
* Make the author link write my name instead of nick (use config with variables)
* Add more links and stuff on about page (linkedin etc)
* Add comment functionality (disquss?)
* Add functionality for pictures with posts. Feature picture per article,
  as well as picture titles. Check out responsive srcset images on
  jekyll community page.
* Limit number of posts shown per page (pagination)
* Make an archive for old blog posts
