title: About me
---

My name is Oskar, and I'm a student of electrical engineering in Link√∂ping,
Sweden. I like many things, but I especially like embedded systems, programming
and learning new things. In this blog I will try to cover various
hobby projects I'm dealing, and perhaps cover any other subject if I
feel that way.
