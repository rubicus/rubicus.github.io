title: About me

My name is Oskar, and I'm a student of electrical engineering in Link√∂ping,
Sweden. In this blog I'll try to cover anything I feel like writing a post
about, and it's probably going to be mostly related to embedded systems,
programming etc. It could be anything from hobby projects to tutorials on some
aspect of development that I find needs to be written about. But it could also
be just a recommendation of a good if I feel so inclined.
