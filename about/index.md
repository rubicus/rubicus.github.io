title: About me
---

My name is Oskar, and I'm a student of electrical engineering in Link√∂ping,
Sweden. I like many things, but I especially like embedded systems, programming
and learning new things in general. In this blog I'm trying to cover various
hobby projects I'm dealing with, and perhaps cover any other subject if I
feel that way.
